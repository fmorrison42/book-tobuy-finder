# Finding a Book To Buy

## This is a pet project (like all the others) 
### to create an app that allows the user to enter a book name or ISBN, then will search major book sellers for matching titles, then compare said books and their prices based on format of text. (i.e. - Kindle, Nook, hardcover, paperback, trade paperback, mass market paperback) With each comparison, it will also create a link to each to allow the user to visit the exact page where they can purchase the book.

### Possible future additions/functionalities:
- use the list of major retailers to create logins for each so the user can always be logged in (and will log them in when they reach the site)
- use logins to show discounted prices if having an account (or special features of their own account) would give them a better price
